# CDC.Health.Survey.Analysis-Statera.Spine
As the data analyst in this assignment from Statera Spine (http://www.stateraspine.com/), I was asked to find and analyze the most recent NHDS, NAMCS, &amp; NHAMCS surveys from the CDC, to support a business pitch. First, Excel files were procured from the National Center for Health Statistics, and time was spent understanding the methodology and content of the surveys as well as the coding system used to present the data. Lookups were used to pull in descriptions of the codes. The surveys were filtered with nested conditional queries, based on procedure codes. Then using Tableau, the target diagnostic codes were ordered in tables and ranked based on the sum of the patient visit weights. These tables (which can be seen on my Tableau Public Profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.marcus.9) were exported as CSVs, summed for each group, and then combined into a final summary table, with the goal to extrapolate relevant national estimates from this sample data. The final results can be seen here.
