# CDC.Health.Survey.Analysis-Statera.Spine

As the data analyst in this assignment from Statera Spine (www.stateraspine.com), I analyzed the most recent NHDS, NAMCS, & NHAMCS surveys from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to support a business pitch. Initial research was done to understand the methodology and content of the surveys, as well as the coding system used to present the data. Excel files were procured from the National Center for Health Statistics, lookups were used to pull in descriptions of the codes, and nested conditional queries filtered the data based on procedure codes. Then using Tableau, the target diagnostic codes were ordered in tables and ranked based on the sum of the patient visit weights. These tables (available on my Tableau Public Profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.marcus.9) were exported as CSVs, summed for each group, and then combined into a final summary table seen here, to extrapolate relevant national estimates.
